# Change log

All notable changes to the ld-find-code-refs program will be documented in this file. This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org).

## [0.2.0] - 2019-01-16
### Fixed
- Use case-sensitive `ag` search so we don't get false positives that look like flag keys but have different casing.

### Changed
- This project has been renamed to `ld-find-code-refs`.
- Logging has been overhauled.
- Project layout has been updated to comply with https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout.
- `updateSequenceId` is now an optional parameter. If not provided, data will always be updated. If provided, data will only be updated if the existing `updateSequenceId` is less than the new `updateSequenceId`.
- Payload limits have been implemented
  - Flags with keys shorter than 3 characters are no longer supported.
  - Lines are truncated after 500 characters.
  - Search is terminated after 5,000 files are matched.
  - Search is terminated after 5,000 hunks are generated.
  - Number of hunks per file is limited to 1,000.
  - A file can only have 500 hunked lines per flag.
- Use `launchdarkly` docker hub namespace instead of `ldactions`.

## [0.1.0] - 2019-01-02
### Changed
- `pushTime` CLI arg renamed to `updateSequenceId`. Its type has been changed from timestamp to integer.
  - Note: this is not considered a breaking change as the CLI args are still in flux. After the 1.0 release arg changes will be considered breaking.

### Fixed
- Upserting repos no longer fails on non-existent repos

## [0.0.1] - 2018-12-14
### Added
- Automated release pipeline for github releases and docker images
- Changelog
