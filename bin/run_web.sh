# For development, it probably makes sense to use one process (``--workers=1``)
# that can handle multiple concurrent connections (``--worker-connections=4``).
# The number of connections you want to handle simultaneously depends on your
# setup and all that.
#
# Make sure you use the ``gevent`` worker class (``--worker-class=gevent``).
# Otherwise it's not going to use the gevent WSGI app and then you're not going
# to be able to handle multiple network connections concurrently.
